# HabiTú

More than a habit tracker — it's your personal habit coach.

HabiTú is built on the core principles from the book Atomic Habits.

This coach guides you from defining your idenitity to suggesting simple habits that help you build lasting systems — step by step, without presure

## 🎯 Problem we´re solving

A lot of pepople want to change their habits, but they make some mistakes in the process:

- They only focus on the **goal**, not on the progress
- The try to do **too much at the beginning** and end up frustrated
- They  don´t know how **start small and progress gradually**
- They dont feel **connected to the habit** they are trying to build
- They are surrounded by **an environment that can sabotage their progress**
- They don´t have **emotional support** that reminds them who they want to become

## 💡 What does habit do

- Can halp you to define your identity
- it suggest you small  and lasting habits
- Guides you to redefine your environment
- It reminds you every day that you are not just someone that “want to achieve something” but someone who is actively building a new identity

## 🔥 Here's what sets it apart:

- **Identity-first approach**
    
    Instead of chasing goals, you start by defining the kind of person you want to be. Habits flow naturally from your chosen identity.
    
- **AI-generated systems**
    
    HabiTú uses AI to suggest identity-aligned habits and environmental tweaks that are small, doable, and sustainable.
    
- **Focus on systems, not streaks**
    
    We don’t measure success by checkmarks. We help you build systems that make progress inevitable.
    
- **Environment-based design**
    
    Your surroundings matter. HabiTú helps you shape your environment so it works *for* your habits, not against them.
    
- **Emotional reinforcement**
    
    Every day, you’re reminded not just of your tasks, but of your identity and how each action reinforces who you're becoming.
